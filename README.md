**About Me**  
My journey into coding started three years ago when I was a WordPress developer.  
While I enjoyed it, my curiosity led me deeper into the world of software development.  
I first explored React, but after discovering Vue, I was instantly hooked.  
Since then, I've dedicated myself to frontend development and am always excited to build new, exciting projects with Vue.
